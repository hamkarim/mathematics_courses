This will grow over time, but current courses include

* Euclidean Geometry (UNI Math 3600)

    A Modified Moore Method course at the "introduction to proof" level. Intended mainly for pre-service
    teachers, but strictly a content course, not a methods course. Material discussed includes basics of
    axiomatic argument and mathematical work, including role, use and making of definitions; basic planar
    geometry including triangles, polygons, circles, compass and straight-edge constructions, and area;
    Euclid books I through IV.

* Mathematics in Decision Making (UNI Math 1100)

    A liberal arts mathematics course at the freshman level. Typically a terminal mathematics course for
    those choosing a non-technical major. The class is sometimes large (approx 70 students) so IBL & Peer
    Instruction Techniques are used. Topics include Cantor's theory of infinite sets, probability and
    statistics, and an introduction to topology (picture hanging puzzles, knots, links, classifying surfaces).
