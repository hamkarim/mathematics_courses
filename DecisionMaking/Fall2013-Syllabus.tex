\textbf{Basic Course Policies and Procedures:}\\
This course will have three main units, with an exam after each one.
\begin{itemize}
\item Topology: Knots, tangles and surfaces
\item Infinity: comparing large sets
\item Data Science: some probability and statistics
\end{itemize}

We will have regular homework, too. It will not be “graded,” but it will receive comments to help you improve. Your final grade for this course will be determined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 90\% - Three Unit Exams (30\% each)
\item 10\% - Homework
\end{itemize}
Exam dates will be announced in class, but should roughly break the semester into thirds.\\[.1in]

\noindent
\textbf{Class Materials}\\
There is no text for this course, though I will hand out resources often in class, and post readings and assignments to the course web page. You should expect to have a reading assignment and homework before each class. I will not track attendance officially, but it is important to come to class and be involved.

Occasionally, it will be helpful to have your own manipulatives. These should be easy to acquire or make, and I’ll let you know when the time comes.

We will often use a classroom response system in class. I have chosen Poll Everywhere for this because it allows students to participate using any web-enabled device, or by text messaging. Please bring a smartphone, cell phone, laptop, or tablet to class so you can participate.\\
