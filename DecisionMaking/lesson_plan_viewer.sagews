(PHP2)\nBreak into groups of 3 students: introduce yourselves, get ribbon, play!</p>\n\n<p>spend 20 minutes working the room. sum up partial progress with unlabelled diagrams.\nencourage, cajole, assist.</p>\n\n<p>hand out syllabus and discuss two types of homework.\nshow website &amp; where to find the homeworks.</p>\n\n<p>do short polleverywhere.com test:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Question: What type of device are you using to participate:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>smartphone</li>\n<li>cell phone &amp; SMS</li>\n<li>tablet</li>\n<li>laptop</li>\n<li>UNI wifi phone</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>question: I understand the difference bwtween the two types of homework</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>true</li>\n<li>false</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>question: I have heard the word &#8220;topology&#8221; before.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>true</li>\n<li>false</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>what happened</h4>\n\n<p>PHP2 with ribbons went well. partial progress was looped solution. one nail works, the other doesn&#8217;t</p>\n\n<p>Internet connection was down. Verizon service in the classroom is bad. Ugly mess.</p>\n\n<h2>Meeting Two: 28 Aug</h2>\n\n<p>Phase 1: Do a bit of peer instruction/guided practice wrap up. polleverywhere questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>question: Which pair of diagram and symbolic description is incorrect?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>give three options with pictures and symbols</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>question: will the correct ones solve PHP2?</p></li>\n<li><p>question: which diagram goes with symbol X?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>give two options</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>question: will either of these solve PHP2?</p></li>\n<li><p>question: I have solved PHP2:  T/F</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Phase 2: Give time to discuss &amp; play. manipulatives available. work in groups of 3.</p>\n\n<h4>what happened</h4>\n\n<p>The Peer Instruction bit went reasonably well. Some students got &#8220;expired shortcode&#8221; errors when texting, so only 50/66 students were able to participate.\nStill, things went as I was told they might. First run: mixed results tending to the correct answer. Second run: right answer over 90%. quick explanation and repeat.</p>\n\n<p>Five students claimed to have solved PHP2. Four had found the solution ABA*B*. One had an incorrect solution. This threw off my plan for phase two.</p>\n\n<p>We did a think-pair share to generate what puzzle there might be for _three_ nails. We got two versions:</p>\n\n<p>PHP3: Find a way to hang a picture on three nails so that removing any one nail makes the picture fall down.</p>\n\n<p>PHP3^2: Find a way to hang a picture on three nails so that removing any one nail leaves the picture hanging, but removing any choice of two nails makes the picture fall down.</p>\n\n<p>I had to adjust the last question on the RGP for Friday (to account for the solution being public). New question is to find _other_ solutions which are genuinely different.</p>\n\n<h2>Meeting Three: 30 Aug</h2>\n\n<p>Phase 1: PollEverywhere questions about reversing direction and pulling nails.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Question: Two of these symbols represent the same diagram, just read by traveling the curve in the two different directions. One is a different diagram. Which one is the odd man out?\n+\n+\n+</p></li>\n<li><p>Question: Consider the diagram with symbol X. What symbol do you get from reversing the direction of travel along the curve?\n+\n+\n+\n+</p></li>\n<li><p>Will the wrapping ABB*A* hold the picture up?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes</li>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Consider the attempted solution ABBBA*BBBA*B*B*B*A. Will pulling nail B make the picture fall down?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>yes</li>\n<li>no</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Consider the attempted solution ABBBA*BBBA*B*B*B*A. Will pulling nail A make the picture fall down?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>yes</li>\n<li>no</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>How many solutions to the picture hanging puzzle on 2 nails do you know?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One, with two descriptions</li>\n<li>Two</li>\n<li>more than two</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Phase 2: goal is to work on PHP3 and PHP3^2</p>\n\n<p>Ask if there are alternate solutions to PHP2.\nMaybe talk about why ABA*B* works&#8211;the alternating pattern!\nThen discuss what might be done to make _other_ solutions based on that idea.\n(compare with other solutions they have found)</p>\n\n<p>Then tell them to solve puzzle PHP3 and PHP3^2. pencil and paper should be enough.</p>\n\n<p>Possible: discuss idea of _topology_.</p>\n"}︡
