Lesson Plans for MDM Fall 2013
===============================

Meeting One: 26 Aug
-------------------

Introduce idea of 2 nail picture hanging puzzle. (PHP2)
Break into groups of 3 students: introduce yourselves, get ribbon, play!

spend 20 minutes working the room. sum up partial progress with unlabelled diagrams.
encourage, cajole, assist.

hand out syllabus and discuss two types of homework.
show website & where to find the homeworks.

do short polleverywhere.com test:

1. Question: What type of device are you using to participate:
    + smartphone
    + cell phone & SMS
    + tablet
    + laptop
    + UNI wifi phone

2. question: I understand the difference bwtween the two types of homework
    + true
    + false

3. question: I have heard the word "topology" before.
    + true
    + false

#### what happened ####
PHP2 with ribbons went well. partial progress was looped solution. one nail works, the other doesn't

Internet connection was down. Verizon service in the classroom is bad. Ugly mess.


Meeting Two: 28 Aug
-------------------

Phase 1: Do a bit of peer instruction/guided practice wrap up. polleverywhere questions:

1. question: Which pair of diagram and symbolic description is incorrect?
    + give three options with pictures and symbols

2. question: will the correct ones solve PHP2?

3. question: which diagram goes with symbol X?
    + give two options

4. question: will either of these solve PHP2?

5. question: I have solved PHP2:  T/F

Phase 2: Give time to discuss & play. manipulatives available. work in groups of 3.

#### what happened ####

The Peer Instruction bit went reasonably well. Some students got "expired shortcode" errors when texting, so only 50/66 students were able to participate.
Still, things went as I was told they might. First run: mixed results tending to the correct answer. Second run: right answer over 90%. quick explanation and repeat.

Five students claimed to have solved PHP2. Four had found the solution ABA\*B\*. One had an incorrect solution. This threw off my plan for phase two. 

We did a think-pair share to generate what puzzle there might be for _three_ nails. We got two versions:

PHP3: Find a way to hang a picture on three nails so that removing any one nail makes the picture fall down.

PHP3^2: Find a way to hang a picture on three nails so that removing any one nail leaves the picture hanging, but removing any choice of two nails makes the picture fall down.

I had to adjust the last question on the RGP for Friday (to account for the solution being public). New question is to find _other_ solutions which are genuinely different.
