Lesson Plans for MDM Fall 2013
===============================

Meeting One: 26 Aug
-------------------

Introduce idea of 2 nail picture hanging puzzle. (PHP2)
Break into groups of 3 students: introduce yourselves, get ribbon, play!

spend 20 minutes working the room. sum up partial progress with unlabelled diagrams.
encourage, cajole, assist.

hand out syllabus and discuss two types of homework.
show website & where to find the homeworks.

do short polleverywhere.com test:

1. Question: What type of device are you using to participate:
    + smartphone
    + cell phone & SMS
    + tablet
    + laptop
    + UNI wifi phone

2. question: I understand the difference bwtween the two types of homework
    + true
    + false

3. question: I have heard the word "topology" before.
    + true
    + false

#### what happened ####
PHP2 with ribbons went well. partial progress was looped solution. one nail works, the other doesn't

Internet connection was down. Verizon service in the classroom is bad. Ugly mess.


Meeting Two: 28 Aug
-------------------

Phase 1: Do a bit of peer instruction/guided practice wrap up. polleverywhere questions:

1. question: Which pair of diagram and symbolic description is incorrect?
    + give three options with pictures and symbols

2. question: will the correct ones solve PHP2?

3. question: which diagram goes with symbol X?
    + give two options

4. question: will either of these solve PHP2?

5. question: I have solved PHP2:  T/F

Phase 2: Give time to discuss & play. manipulatives available. work in groups of 3.

#### what happened ####

The Peer Instruction bit went reasonably well. Some students got "expired shortcode" errors when texting, so only 50/66 students were able to participate.
Still, things went as I was told they might. First run: mixed results tending to the correct answer. Second run: right answer over 90%. quick explanation and repeat.

Five students claimed to have solved PHP2. Four had found the solution ABA\*B\*. One had an incorrect solution. This threw off my plan for phase two.

We did a think-pair share to generate what puzzle there might be for _three_ nails. We got two versions:

PHP3: Find a way to hang a picture on three nails so that removing any one nail makes the picture fall down.

PHP3^2: Find a way to hang a picture on three nails so that removing any one nail leaves the picture hanging, but removing any choice of two nails makes the picture fall down.

I had to adjust the last question on the RGP for Friday (to account for the solution being public). New question is to find _other_ solutions which are genuinely different.


Meeting Three: 30 Aug
---------------------

Phase 1: PollEverywhere questions about reversing direction and pulling nails.

1. Question: Two of these symbols represent the same diagram, just read by traveling the curve in the two different directions. One is a different diagram. Which one is the odd man out?
    + one
    + two
    + one read other way

2. Question: Consider the diagram with symbol X. What symbol do you get from reversing the direction of travel along the curve?
    + switch order
    + switch stars
    + correct (both above)
    + mixed up.

3. Will the wrapping ABB\*A\* hold the picture up?
    + Yes
    + No

4. Consider the attempted solution ABBBA\*BBBA\*B\*B\*B\*A. Will pulling nail B make the picture fall down?
    + yes
    + no

5. Consider the attempted solution ABBBA\*BBBA\*B\*B\*B\*A. Will pulling nail A make the picture fall down?
    + yes
    + no

6. How many solutions to the picture hanging puzzle on 2 nails do you know?
    + One, with two descriptions
    + Two
    + more than two

Phase 2: goal is to work on PHP3 and PHP3^2


Ask if there are alternate solutions to PHP2.
Maybe talk about why ABA\*B\* works--the alternating pattern!
Then discuss what might be done to make _other_ solutions based on that idea.
(compare with other solutions they have found)

Then tell them to solve puzzle PHP3 and PHP3^2. pencil and paper should be enough.

Possible: discuss idea of _topology_.

#### What Happened ####

Never got past phase 1.
questions went well, but six of them fills an hour.
Best one was \#4. 
Students were split 3/2 in favor of correct response.
At revote after discussion, there was _no change_.
I gave a short discussion about which was correct and why.
Response to \#5 was unanimous on first vote.
That was awesome.

Meeting Four: 3 September
--------------------------------------

Phase 1: Do peer instruction polling for short time.

1. Question: The following wire wrappings all start BA\*.  Which one is a solution to PHP2?

    + BA\*AB
    + BA\*AB\*
    + BA\*BA
    + BA\*B\*A

2. Question: Consider the attempted solution to PHP3 given by ACB\*A\*C. Which of the following make the picture fall down? 

	+ pull A only
	+ pull B only
	+ pull C only
	+ pull A and B together
	+ pull A and C together
	+ pull B and C together
	+ none

Phase 2: Small group play time!
get solutions to PHP3 and PHP4, if you can.

#### What Happened ####


Meeting Five: 5 September
-------------------------------------

Activity Day: Human Knot game. Take class outside.

Phase One:  four person groups "any old connections."
Try to untangle.
Check for knots or links.
(Links are more likely.)

Next try six person groups (maybe five)

Then apply rules: 

+ if group has even number of people: everyone grasps a right hand of someone _not_ next to them with their right hand.
+ if group has odd number of people: all but one person does that, but the last person uses right hand to grab some left hand not next to them.
+ Then grab left hands of people not next to them.

Phase Two: Do larger groups

Say size 9 or ten with the rules

Sum up discussion with ideas of "knot," "link," and "isotopy" for topological equivalence
